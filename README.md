# DESCRIPTION 

This is a command line application running on NODE JS  The layout of the note taker was key including setting up the folder structure containing the public folder that was included in the application. 

 The app.js required the manager, PATH, FS, and INQUIRER.  Path was used for output to public files. UUID.js and fsUtils.js were helpers in the application.

# INSTALLATION 

EXPRESS Router, NODE JS, INQUIRER, FS file system, PATH, were used for read and write functions

# USAGE 

 
# LICENSE 

Open source license

# CONTRIBUTING 

SOLO PROJECT

# TESTS 


 
# QUESTIONS 

My challenges for this project was to get the tests to function correctly, mainly to get file paths and get methods to pass.  It is quite a complex project to get all the files to work together, to have tests pass, and a lot of repetitive work with each of the subclasses.
