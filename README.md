# DESCRIPTION 

This is a command line application running on NODE JS  The layout of the note taker was key including setting up the folder structure containing the public folder that was included in the application. 

 The app.js required the manager, PATH, FS, and INQUIRER.  Path was used for output to public files. UUID.js and fsUtils.js were helpers in the application.

# INSTALLATION 

EXPRESS Router, NODE JS, INQUIRER, FS file system, PATH, were used for read and write functions.  PACKAGE JSON to contain the notes text and title. The helpers used were UUID and FS utilies to generate a random string of numbers and letters. The app.js file required the methods.js in folder db to readFromFile, readAndAppend, writeToFile functions.  HEROKU helped with live deployment of application to a broad userbase.  Routes needed EXPRESS and PATH.  Server.js contains middleware to parse JSON and for static files.

in the code to either run on a process environment port or localhost 3001.
